# SLOOP
Sleep-cafeine analysis app for the course on personal data interaction

Caffeine effects on sleep are personalised and can change over time, for this reason, the app "Sloop" was created to 
give users a system to collect, reflect and take action on their caffeine intake in order to improve their sleep 
quality and health.
